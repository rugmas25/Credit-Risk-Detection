AGE: Age in years </br>
PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above) </br>
PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above) </br>
PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above) </br>
PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above) </br>
PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above) </br>
PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)</br>

Roughly, the project can be divided into the following sections: </br>
1. Data Exploration and Validation </br>
2. Data Cleaning </br>
3. Model Building and Validation (Logistic Regression) </br>
4. Handling Class Imbalance </br>
5. Feature Engineering </br>
6. Model Building and Validation (Decison Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost) </br> </br>

## Model Accuracy obtained from the various algorithms: </br> </br>

**1. Logistic Regression:** 78.833 % </br>
**2. Decision Tree :** 75.03 % </br>
**3. Random Forest:** 81.75 % </br>
**4. XGBoost:** 81. 43 %
